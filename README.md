# 🧠 Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective

This project explores the relationship between market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) and trader performance on the Hyperliquid platform. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns that can inform smarter trading strategies by analyzing trade outcomes against sentiment shifts.

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

1. **Fear-Greed Index** (`fear_greed_index.csv`)  
   - Date-wise market sentiment: "Fear" or "Greed"

2. **Trader Data** (`historical_data.csv`)  
   - Trade-level data including price, size, side, PnL, and timestamp

---

## 📈 Key Analyses

- ✅ Merged sentiment with trade data by date
- ✅ Calculated metrics:
  - Average PnL by sentiment
  - Win rate (% profitable trades)
  - Average trade size
- ✅ Created visualizations (boxplots, bar charts)

## 📌 Key Insights

| Metric                 | Greed Days        | Fear Days         |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Avg. Profit (PnL)      | Higher             | Lower              |
| Win Rate               | Higher             | Lower              |
